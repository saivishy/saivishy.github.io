## Applied Machine Learning 

___

### [ML and Society: Teaching Tools](http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~atri/ml-and-soc/spr22/project/teaching.html)

I learned how to implement socially equitable ML and better understand the propagative effect of ML on society as a part of the course [CSE 540: ML and Society](http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~atri/ml-and-soc/spr22/index.html). I worked on enhancing the course instructional materials as well.

### Distracting Message Identification For Instant Messaging Platforms

Worked under [Dr. Saad Yunus Sait](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department-of-computational-intelligence/faculty/drsaad) on this undergraduate research project. Built a preprocessing pipeline to consolidate and process messages from groups. Reconstructed models adapted from existing research to perform context-based filtering of distracting messages. The findings of this work are being revised for a journal submission.

## Parallel and Disrtibuted Programming

### [SCoOL - Scalable Common Optimization Library <i class="fab fa-fw fa-gitlab" aria-hidden="true "></i>](https://gitlab.com/SCoRe-Group/scool)

Worked under [Prof. Jaric Zola](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~jzola/) for what would later be my Masters capstone project. Designed and implementing a general purpose runtime executor for search space exploration and optimisation  problems (NP-hard) by adapting the [bulk synchronous parallel (BSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel) model of programming. The executor was built using the parallel runtime framework - [HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx). The PR for this feature can be viewed [here](https://gitlab.com/SCoRe-Group/scool/-/merge_requests/22).

### [Distributed Key Value Store <i class="fab fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/saivishy/distributed-key-val-store)

Developed a fault-tolerant distributed key value store by implementing the [RAFT consensus protocol](https://raft.github.io/). The data was made accessible via REST endpoints and the frontend was designed using HTML and CSS. 

### [Gaussian KDE: GPU Implementation <i class="fab fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/saivishy/kde-gpu)

Parallel implementation of gaussian kernel density estimation computation for a set of floating point numbers using NVIDIA CUDA.

### [Rooting Graph Nodes: Using Spark <i class="fab fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/saivishy/rooting-connected-components)

Finds the roots of each node in a graph of connected components using Apache Spark. Distributed implementation tested on [UB's HPC](https://www.buffalo.edu/ccr/support/research_facilities/ub-hpc.html).

### [Distributed Sorting: Using Open MPI <i class="fab fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/saivishy/distributed-sorting)

Implements count sort on a range of short integers distributed across a set of processors in a cluster using Open MPI. Implemented on [UB's HPC](https://www.buffalo.edu/ccr/support/research_facilities/ub-hpc.html).

## Blockchain

### [Buffalo Farmers Marketplace <i class="fab fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/saivishy/buffalo-farmers-marketplace)

A  decentralized marketplace to facilitate transparent interactions to buy produce from your local farmers market. The frontend was built using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. 

## Bots and Automation 

### [TARS : TA Assistance Bot <i class="fab fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/solarillion/TARS)

Integrated the slack API and Google calendar API to get TA office hours posted in the workplace via TARS. Implemented periodic scheduling using cron jobs and shell scripting.
