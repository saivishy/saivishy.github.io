## [A Non-intrusive Machine Learning Solution for Malware Detection and Data Theft Classification in Smartphones](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06511.pdf)

Published in *The 21st International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2021) Kraḱow, Poland, 2021*

Lead a team towards condensing [one of the largest datasets](https://github.com/ymirsky/SherLock) (10 billion+ records) for malware classification in smartphones to 0.1% of its feature set whilst retaining threshold accuracy reported by competing data intensive methods through efficient data
preprocessing and online learning.

## [Real-time Surveillance based Crime Detection for Edge Devices](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/89901/89901.pdf)

Published in *The 15th International Conference for Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP 2020), Valleta, Malta*

I lead a team to implement efficient multiple instance learning on optical flow by introducing early stopping and intuitive undersampling to tackle otherwise computationally expensive crime detection for video. Deployed and tested on a resource constrained device: Raspberry Pi3 (ARM v8) performing 2.3x times faster then the benchmark servers (Intel Xeon) using just a third of the number of cores.

## [A Two-Stage Machine Learning Approach to Forecast the Lifetime of Movies in a Multiplex](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-39442-4_36)

Published in *The Future of Information and Communication Conference (FICC 2020), San Francisco, USA.*

Developed a two-stage model to estimate the number of weeks a movie in a multiplex would successfully run based on past occupancy/crowd behaviour. The solution is currently in use by one of India’s leading cinema exhibitors.
