I am a CS graduate student at the University at Buffalo. My areas of study are parallel and distributed programming, applied machine learning, and data science. Currently, I use my graduate degree as a means to bridge my gaps in understanding and complement my existing skills if not enhance them. 

Some of my recent exploits during my masters program are - being an open-source contributor to [SCoOL - Scalable Common Optimization Library](https://gitlab.com/SCoRe-Group/scool) , understanding racial bias in ML Systems and [enhacing the teaching material](http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~atri/ml-and-soc/spr22/project/teaching.html) in this area, making a [fault tolerent distributed key value store](https://github.com/saivishy/distributed-key-val-store). More of my work can be found [here](google.com). 
During my undergrad I worked in the areas of anomaly detection, scalable computing, and behavioral modeling publishing these works at international conferences.
 
Apart from having fun hacking away a solution, I enjoy making films, discovering new foods, and playing soccer. Feel free to drop me an email if you would like to connect!
